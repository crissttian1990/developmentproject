                    The CEO from InfoTrack is very interested in SEO and how this can improve Sales. Every morning he searches
                    the keyword “land registry searches” in Google and counts down to see where and how many times their
                    company, www.infotrack.co.uk sits on the list. Seeing the CEO do this every day, a smart software developer
                    at InfoTrack decides to write a small application for him that will automatically perform this operation and return
                    the result to the screen. They design and code some software that receives a string of keywords, and a string
                    URL. This is then processed to return a string of numbers for where the resulting URL is found in Google. For
                    example “1, 10, 33” or “0”. The CEO is only interested if their URL appears in the first 100 results.

                        Make sure the application can be loaded and run with minimum configuration.
                        We recommend cloning / downloading a new instance of your application yourself and try to run it
                        before you submit it.
