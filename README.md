# Infotrack - Development test


Notes
- The application is done to run with the minimun configuration. This app doesn't use a database

Task
The CEO from InfoTrack is very interested in SEO and how this can improve Sales. Every morning he searches
the keyword “land registry searches” in Google and counts down to see where and how many times their
company, www.infotrack.co.uk sits on the list. Seeing the CEO do this every day, a smart software developer
at InfoTrack decides to write a small application for him that will automatically perform this operation and return
the result to the screen. They design and code some software that receives a string of keywords, and a string
URL. This is then processed to return a string of numbers for where the resulting URL is found in Google. For
example “1, 10, 33” or “0”. The CEO is only interested if their URL appears in the first 100 results.


Requirements
▪ Demonstrate your skills! - showcase your .NET web application knowledge
▪ Do this either as a .NET Core Webapi & SPA pair, or classic .NET MVC application
▪ Make use of this URL: https://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&q=land+registry+search
▪ Scrape the website. Don't use 3rd party libraries or google API, we want to see how you structure
your logic
▪ In the UI, you need to allow user to enter the search phrase and URL
▪ If you need to use any Database, please make sure to use SQL Express


Tips
▪ Demonstrate OO Programming & clean separation of concern
▪ If you have used JS frameworks before and want go an extra mile in demonstrating your
skills(eg,Vue.js,Angular,React,Typescript), feel free to use it in this project.
▪ If you have some extra time, feel free to add extra features, eg:
o Trends / history of where InfoTrack ranked on a daily / weekly basis
o Scrape other search engine
If you don't, it's completely fine. Better to get the basics right!
▪ Don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on this project.
